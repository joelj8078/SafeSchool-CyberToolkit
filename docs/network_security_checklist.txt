# SafeSchool Cyber Toolkit - Secure Network Checklist

This checklist outlines common security best practices for local school/institution networks.

✅ Devices & Services:
- [ ] All network devices use strong, unique admin credentials
- [ ] Only essential services (e.g., HTTPS, SSH) are running
- [ ] No legacy services like Telnet, FTP, or SMBv1 exposed

✅ Router Configuration:
- [ ] Admin panel is not accessible from WAN (remote internet)
- [ ] Default passwords are changed
- [ ] UPnP is disabled
- [ ] Firmware is updated

✅ Port Security:
- [ ] No unnecessary open ports on router or devices
- [ ] HTTP (port 80) is redirected or disabled in favor of HTTPS
- [ ] Telnet (port 23), FTP (port 21), and similar insecure ports are closed

✅ Monitoring & Visibility:
- [ ] Devices on the network are known and documented
- [ ] Intrusion detection is in place (e.g., router logs, alerts)
- [ ] Guest and staff/student networks are separated (VLAN or separate SSIDs)

✅ General:
- [ ] Strong Wi-Fi encryption (WPA2 or WPA3) is used
- [ ] MAC address filtering or other access control mechanisms are active
- [ ] Devices have updated OS and antivirus
